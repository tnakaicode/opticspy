# This fork can by used with python 3.6

fork from <https://github.com/Sterncat/opticspy.git>

## To test
* mkdir /tmp/github/
* cd /tmp/github/
* git clone https://github.com/Diti24/opticspy.git
* Add codebase to python path: ```pip install -e opticspy```
* from opticspy.ray_tracing import *
The basics is working...
New_Lens.add_surface(number=11,radius=177.41176,thickness=7,glass='N-SK16_schott')
gives an error to be investigated...

Opticspy is a python module for optics application. I want this for a long time. One reason is I know both optics and python, so why no develop some optics tools? The second reason is that there is not much opensource, easy-to-use optics program module(matlab has great fuctions but do not specify to optics application). I want this could be developed in to a core for a future web application for optics.

### Followings are primary opticspy modules:

#### 1. Real ray tracing and Lens Design:

* #### [Example 1: Basic functions introduction](http://sterncat.github.io/files/Real_Ray_Tracing.html)

* #### [Example 2: A double gauss lens example](http://sterncat.github.io/files/Double_Gauss.html)

* #### [Example 3: Build a Petzval lens with codev seq file](http://sterncat.github.io/files/CodeV_Convertor.html)

* #### [Example 4: Build a microscope lens with codev seq file](http://sterncat.github.io/files/Microscope.html)

#### 2. Zernike Polynomial Methods

* #### [Basic Zernike Polynomial Methods](http://sterncat.github.io/files/Zernike_Polynomial_Method.html)

* #### [Zernike Polynomial Fitting Methods](http://sterncat.github.io/files/Zernike_Polynomial_Fitting_Method.html)

* #### [Orthonormal Rectangular Polynomials](http://sterncat.github.io/files/Orthonormal_Rectangular_Polynomials.html)

#### 3. Interferometer and Testing Methods

* #### [Basic Interferometer Methods](http://sterncat.github.io/files/Interferometer_Method.html)

* #### [Phase shift interferometer and surface rebuild](http://sterncat.github.io/files/PSI.html)

* #### [Hartmann Test Patterns](http://sterncat.github.io/files/Hartmann_Test.html)

#### 4. [Wave Propagation and Aberration Methods](http://sterncat.github.io/files/Diffraction_Method.html)

#### 5. [Lens aberration, Jones matrix and gauss beam methods ](http://sterncat.github.io/files/Other_functions.html)


### There are some interesting derivative from opticspy:

#### 1. [A Zernike Polynomial GUI app based on opticspy and PyQt5](https://github.com/Sterncat/zernikeapp)
#### It is very easy to reuse or "wrap" opticspy module with a GUI(e.g. PyQt)

#### 2. [Zernike Surface gif show](http://sterncat.github.io/images/zernikegif.gif)

#### This is the [Opticspy project page](http://opticspy.org)

#### This project is hosted on github in [https://github.com/Sterncat/opticspy](https://github.com/Sterncat/opticspy)

## Installing
#### Use pip install (recommend)
```
$ pip install opticspy
```
#### [Or download here](http://sterncat.github.io/files/opticspy-0.2.1.tar.gz)

```
$ python2.7 setup.py install
```
#### Some trouble shooting please read [troubleshooting.md](https://github.com/Sterncat/opticspy/blob/master/troubleshooting.md)
## How to use
```
>>> import opticspy
```

And just have fun with it!

## What I want
<ul>
  <li>1. After import the module and you will get some functions that can do some calculation and education in optics</li>
  <li>2. Parameters should be very flexible, and the results should be shown in visualized, intuitionistic figures.</li>
  <li>3. After development of core, I want it be dynamic web application(with Javascript)</li>
  <li>4. I even hope one day it will become a part of online optics design application, who knows?</li>
</ul>
